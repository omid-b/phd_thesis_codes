# GSpecDisp
A Matlab package for phase-velocity dispersion measurement from ambient-noise correlations


# Requirements
GspecDisp can be run on any operation system with Matlab and also its Mapping toolbox. It is written based on the new Matlab Graphics which are introduced in Release 2014b.

# Documentation
Manual and tutorial of GSpecDisp can be found in the folder called Doc (path is: "./GSpecDisp1.4/Doc").

# Installation
No installation is needed. Instead download the package and after unzipping into a desired directory, you need to go to the directory and run "GSpecDisp.m" by pressing F5 in the Matlab editor or typing in the Matlab command window (path is: "./GSpecDisp1.4
/GSpecDisp.m").

# Contact
To report bugs, suggestions and comments, or to get help, you can send an email to gspecdisp@gmail.com.

If you get errors in Matlab, please include some of your SAC files and your "user_values.mat" file (path is: "./GSpecDisp1.4/defaults/user_values.mat") in your email. Please also copy and paste the complete error message in the email, i.e. with everything in the Matlab’s command window in red.
