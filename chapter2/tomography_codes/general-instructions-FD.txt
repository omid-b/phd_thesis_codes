SURFACE WAVE TOMOGRAPHY CODE - SERGEI LEBEDEV
=============================================

INPUT DATA
==========

Each phase velocity curve must be in the following format:

STA1 STA2				! names of stations
LHZ LHZ					! not important, but must be there
lat1 lon1 lat2 lon2			! lats & longs of stations
period(s) phasevel(km/s) error(km/s)	! phase velocity data
period(s) phasevel(km/s) error(km/s)
period(s) phasevel(km/s) error(km/s)
...

Place the dispersion curves into a subdirectory of the main tomography directory
(e.g. /home/xyzt/sw-tomography/dataset).
In this directory, make a list of all dispersion curves. The filenames must include
the entire path (e.g. /home/xyzt/sw-tomography/dataset/FRB_FCC.disp).

BASIC BACKGROUND
================

3 main programs for the inversion process (plus a lot of auxiliary codes and
scripts to make everything work, carry out quality control, resolution tests,
etc.)

1) "bac" - builds an approximately equidistant triangular model grid covering
the globe; writes the "A" and "d" of the matrix Ax=d for the inversion.

Compilation: gfortran -g -O3 -o bac bac.f tri_sub_dble.o tri_dble.o

Before compiling bac, will likely need to recompile the C functions
tri_sub_dble.c and tri_dble.c to create new object files tri_sub_dble.o
and tri_dble.o if recompiling on a different platform; try the original .o
files first in the bac compilation though in case they work already.

Running: bac < inbac > outbac

Requires input file "inbac" of the following form:

/.../some_dataset/list			! list or directory of phasevel files*
10					! number of periods
10  0		outlier_info/010_orig/path_sel 		! period, refvel, pathlist
15  0		outlier_info/015_orig/path_sel
20  0		outlier_info/020_orig/path_sel
25  0		outlier_info/025_orig/path_sel
...
200 0		outlier_info/200_orig/path_sel
2                       ! anisotropy: 0 = none, 1 = 2psi-only, 2 = 2psi and 4psi
0.                      ! path width, km (e.g. 0 km or 100 km)
200. 40.                ! model and integration grid spacing (e.g. 100 30)

*In the first line there is initially a path to a list of phase-velocity files
containing the interstation measurements. The code should be used in this form
for the initial run.

There is a procedure for outlier-exclusion (see below), in which the selected
subsets of the dataset are written into lists for subsequent runs. Their location
is given in column 3 of inbac. When running bac with selected paths, the first
line should be adjusted to the working directory containing the subdirectories
with the selected paths, and must end with a "/".

If inverting for anisotropy, one should use both 2psi and 4psi. Although Rayleigh waves in
the mantle are primarily sensitive to 2psi, the inversion for both types allows some idea
of leakage between parameters, and of areas where azimuthal coverage is not sufficient for
a reliable estimate of 2psi anisotropy. Both 2psi and 4psi anisotropy are important in the
crust, though 4psi is rarely shown or interpreted in studies.

Grid-spacing: Integration grid should be around 3-5 times smaller than model grid. Model
grid should reflect the level of detail required in the tomographic model, which in turn
is decided by looking at station and path density in detail. (e.g. for Hudson Bay I used
a 200km model-grid spacing, and for Greenland which had a much denser path coverage I
used 100 km with 30 km for the integration grid.)

The output of bac is a set of files named according to the period, e.g.:
colsums020, ers020, matrix020, matrix_key020, paths020, path_list020, rhs020,
shell020, shell_key020, stations020
"rhs" and "ers" are the right-hand side of the inversion matrix (d) and errors,
"matrix_key" contains summary information on the matrix, "shell" and "shell_key"
define the grid.
"paths" and "stations" are location files used in GMT plotting and "path_list"
is the list of paths used.

2) Script "sortdirs.csh" takes all the bac outputs and sorts them into directories
named for period e.g. 010, 015... 200. The files are placed into these directories
and their period suffices are removed e.g. "matrix020" becomes "020/matrix" etc.

3) "iac" - carries out the inversion by solving the Ax=d system using linearised
least-squares inversion with smoothing and damping... the "A" and "d" come from
the output of program bac.

Compilation: gfortran -O3 -g -o iac iac.f iac_subs.f

Running: iac < iniac

Requires input file "iniac" of the following form:

900     ! max number of iterations
25      ! intermediate solutions to output, after different # of iter (next line)
1 2 3 5 7 10 15 20 30 40 50 70 100 130 160 200 250 300 350 400 500 600 700 800 900
0.05 0.05 0.05  ! a,b,c: norm damping on C,2psi,4psi (a*dC=0; b*A=0; b*B=0; c*C=0; c*E=0)
1 2 2           ! smoothing:  d*dC - d*(sum(dC(neighbours))/num_nbrs)=0; same for 2,4psi
0.5 1 1         ! gradient damping
0 0 0           ! norm-damp scaling, yes(1) or no(0): Vs, 2psi, 4psi 
0.6 0.6 0.6     ! norm-damp scaling eps: Vs, 2psi, 4psi 

Note that this file is automatically created when the script "do-iac.csh" is run.

Intermediate solutions are written into files named "solution0001", "solution0003"...
Final solution is written into file "solution"

4) "xsc" processes  inversion solution to reader-friendly and GMT-friendly format.

Compilation: gfortran -O3 -o xsc xsc.f

Running: xsc < inxc

Requires input file "inxc" of the following form:

0		! plot columnsums? (no)
0		! smoothing (no)
200. 200. 200.	! scale limits *
1 0.2		! make gridded output (1) or stick with points (0); grid spacing (deg)
1 0.7		! plot whole model (0) or just regions covered by paths (1); max
		  distance from nearest path (deg)

This file is automatically created within the script "do-iac.csh" as well.

* if < 1, plots as a proportion of the maximum value of the heterogeneity (useful for
a first look); if > 1, plots up to a fixed range (i.e. sets the colour scale for the
isotropic part of the plot and scales the size of bars for the anisotropy)
(Default is 0.5 0.5 0.5)
Note that the scale limits allow xsc to create its own colour palette file for the model.
However, this has been superseded by Laura's (nicer) colour palettes; see "colourXX.cpt"
where the "XX" refers to the scale limits in percent heterogeneity.

GENERAL PROCEDURE FOR INVERSION WORK
====================================

1) Gather data together in a directory; make sure all codes are compiled.


2) Carry out a preliminary run of "bac" to make sure everything is working OK; in case of problems,
check output logfile "outbac". Run "sortdirs.csh" to sort bac output into relevant period
directories.


3) Use script "do-iac.csh" to run through the inversions for the set of periods; this runs the
codes "iac" and "xsc" automatically, using "iniac" and "inxc" input files set up in the script,
then plots the results and generates a text file with the inversion statistics for each period.

Once it's certain that everything is working...


4) Carry out the following outlier exclusion procedure to make sure there are no spurious paths
that are impossible for the inversion scheme to fit (as these paths may have data issues, and
would thus bias the variance-reduction statistics etc.):

i) Run bac/iac/xsc using VERY low values of smoothing and damping parameters to produce a rough
model that therefore fits the data as well as possible. Rename the period directories to XXX_orig
(e.g. 020_orig).

Program excl_outl; compilation gfortran -o ../bin/excl_outl excl_outl.f

This program allows one to exclude outlier measurements. The selected subsets of the
initial data set at each period are written into lists and those lists are used in
subsequent runs of the bac program.
In this case, adjust input file inbac so that the first line is just the directory
in which the period-specific lists are held (with a "/" at the end), then each of the
period-specific lines gives the directory in which the list of selected paths (path_sel)
is held.

The program outputs:
     rhs1 (line number; original rhs; rhs scaled to km/s; curve-file name), 
     syndat (line #; synthetic rhs in km/s; curve-file name), 
     syndif (line #; data-synthetic rhs mismatch in km/s; data-synthetic 
	     rhs mismatch as proportion of measurement error; curve-file name),
     path_sel (the list with selected, non-outlier measurements,  
	       to be used for a re-run of bac.f), 
     path_nsl (the list with rejected, outlier measurements), 
     paths_sel.xy and paths_bad.xy for GMT plotting.

The thresholds used to separate the outliers can be of different types,
   the program has interactive input and asks for the type of and 
   the value of the threshold factor.
   types of threshold factors for path selection are:
      1 -- threshold is a constant in m/s (e.g. 20), '
            paths with misfit below the constant are selected
      2 -- threshold is a proportion of the measurement error (e.g. 1),
            paths with misfit below threshold*err are selected
      3 -- threshold is a percentage of smallest-misfit paths to keep (e.g. 75),
            with absolute misfit values compared
      4 -- threshold is a percentage of smallest-misfit paths to keep (e.g. 75),
            with the misfits compared as proportions of measurement errors

My recommendation - choose option 2 - proportion of the measurement error.

ii) Use script "outliers.csh" to run the outlier-exclusion algorithm. I do not like the idea of
fixing the percentage of paths to keep (what if lots are bad, or what if they are all good?) so
I've used the option of excluding paths for a threshold of 0.5 * measurement error. (You can try
different proportions and see how many paths get excluded...)

iii) Create a new directory "outlier_info" and place the "XXX_orig" directories into it. Modify
the "inbac" input file so that the first line gives the path in which the "outlier_info" directory
is situated; make sure the line ends with a "/".

iv) Rerun bac/iac/xsc with the original moderate smoothing values and check everything is working.
Take a close look at this stage at the plots and the inversion statistics files; at this stage
you'll be starting to see the structures resolved by the tomography. It's worth keeping the results
in a new subdirectory (e.g. "run_


5) Smoothing/damping tests - these are necessary for getting the best possible regularisation
parameters for the inversion (which will be different for every data set; depends on the data
themselves and the path coverage). Best option is to pick one period to do the tests; perhaps
not the period with the very best path coverage, but one with a good number of paths.
The script "smoothtest.csh" carries out sets of inversions for different smoothing parameters
at a fixed damping value, and "damptest.csh" is the equivalent for trying out different damping
parameters. In both cases, the scripts read the sets of test parameters from a text file - see
"smthtestvals-example". Each line gives a set of 3 smoothing (or damping) parameters, where the
first is for isotropic, the second is for 2psi anisotropy and the third is for 4psi anisotropy.
One should look at statistics for varied isotropic smoothing with anisotropic smoothing held
constant, then separately look at statistics for isotropic smoothing held constant and anisotropic
smoothing varied. 2psi and 4psi anisotropy should be equal.

Recommendations:
- cover a wide range of values (e.g. 0.01 to 10)
- have a set where anisotropy is constant and isotropic smoothness varies, then another
  where isotropy is constant and anisotropic smoothness varies (as the two tend to trade
  off)
- keep 2psi and 4psi smoothness the same, otherwise it will be more difficult to gauge
  the tradeoffs and leakage


For a given set, check the "stats-info" file for the following information:
- remaining variance (= 1 - variance reduction; smaller value = better fit)
- isotropic or anisotropic roughness values

These parameters can be used to plot trade-off curves for isotropic or anisotropic tests. Like
the body-wave tomography, a good rule of thumb is to choose smoothing parameters that give results
at the 'knee' of the trade-off curve. Also it is important at the same time to look at the phase
velocity maps from the different inversions and use a visual subjective impression to decide if
the parameters give results that are 'too smooth', 'too rough' or 'about right'.
Note also that anisotropic resolution is rarely as good as isotropic resolution, so the final
choices of smoothing and damping parameters should have a smaller value for isotropic than
than anisotropic.

Once the final choice of smoothing parameters is made, do a complete bac/iac/xsc run and plot out
the resulting phase velocity maps. Check the statistics text file for the maximum values of the
perturbations and play around with values in the inxc files so that you can rerun the plotting
codes (see script "plotall.csh") with near-constant colour scales in order to compare degrees
of heterogeneity.

[Information from Sergei:
The smoothing penalizes the difference between the value at a grid point and the average over
this grid point and its closest neighbours. This is similar to penalizing the second derivative.
Hence, the largest anomalies are often at the periphery where data sampling is actually almost
negligible.
The other regularisation option is gradient damping, which is penalizing the difference between
values at every pair of neighbouring grid points (similar to penalizing the 1st derivative)]


6) Adjustment of reference velocities; when the inversion is run, the initial reference velocity
is the average of all the phase velocities across the region for a given period. In theory this
should balance the phase velocity maps such that the average value of the phase velocity is 0.0
In practice, this is rarely the case, so some adjustment is necessary to get a proper balance.
When bac is run with the value 0 in the 2nd column of the "inbac" file, the data average is taken
as the reference velocity, and this value can be found in the last column of the text file
"matrix_key".
To make the adjustments:
i) for each period, copy the reference velocity from "matrix_key" to the 2nd column of "inbac".
Do a complete run of bac/iac/xsc and note the average value of the isotropic phase velocity.
If it is not zero, adjust the reference velocity in "inbac" and repeat. Continue doing this for
all the different periods until the average isotropic phase velocity is zero.


7) Resolution tests - see the (long) script "resotests.csh". There are lots of different types of
resolution tests one can do; some are 'prepackaged' through Sergei's codes, others require more
user decisions and inputs. Broadly there are 4 types:

i) Leakage tests - one takes the results of the inversion for a chosen period. One component of
that phase-velocity map (isotropic-only, 2psi-only or 4psi-only) becomes the input model for the
resolution test; this is used to generate synthetic data which are then inverted using the same
path distribution and regularisation parameters, with a little Gaussian noise added to the system.
What one looks for here are results where the chosen input component is well-recovered and the
other two components have very small amplitude (ideally zero, but that will not happen!)

ii) Synthetic starting model is a simple gradient from fast to slow across the study area; there
are pre-defined "grad" models hardwired into the resolution-test codes with different directions
for the gradients (e.g. north-south, NW-SE etc.)

iii) 'Reversed' anisotropy ('anisrev' in the script) - this is a similar idea to the leakage tests
in that it uses a real model. In this case the input to the resolution test is the original model
but with the 2psi anisotropy rotated through 90 degrees. This is a useful test to see if bias in
azimuthal coverage might affect the anisotropy fast direction in the results. Ideally the rotated
directions should be well-recovered.

iv) 'Spike' tests - this can be used to generate patterns of slow and fast phase velocity anomalies
to make a checkerboard pattern or to assess the resolution of isolated shapes and structures in the
model. Each grid point in the inversion has its own unique grid number (which varies from period to
period) and the 'spike' anomalies are made by 'switching on' grid numbers of one's choice - these
become slow anomalies. The steps for this process are:
a) use script "gridnos-from-shell.csh" for a period or several periods to plot the grid numbers
directly on a map of the study area. Based on these plots, decide on sets of grid points to 'switch
on' to make anomaly patterns.
b) for each chosen pattern, create a file called "spkN" where N is a number from 1 to 6. See file
"spk-example". The first number in the file says how many grid points are 'switched on'; the other
numbers specify which grid points those are.
c) The same input files can be used to build resolution tests for 2psi anisotropy ('spike N anis'
in the resolution test script).

For each resolution test, there will be a plot of the synthetic model and a plot of the recovered
model from the inversion. You may need to try the plotting with different colour scale maxima. You
can also look at the inversion statistics text file.
